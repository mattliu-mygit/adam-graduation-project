Thanks for always making time for my last-minute performance requests like the Nutcracker. Not to mention all the promos you do for our troupe haha! The moment I remember most with you is having my work office get framed by SGA for losing your Squishable. Turns out they had misspelled your name, and it was sitting in a closet for months until I gave it to you. Hope you have a blast after graduation",
